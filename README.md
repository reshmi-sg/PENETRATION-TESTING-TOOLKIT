# This repository contains the deliverable for my CodTech Internship Cybersecurity Task titled Penetration Testing Toolkit. The goal of this project was to design and implement a Python-based toolkit consisting of basic modules used by ethical hackers and penetration testers to identify security flaws in systems and networks.Penetration testing (also called ethical hacking) is a method of evaluating the security of a system by simulating attacks from malicious actors. Tools developed for this purpose help discover vulnerabilities before real attackers can exploit them. My task focused on building a beginner-friendly toolkit to understand the practical aspects of cybersecurity.
# To develop a modular penetration testing toolkit in Python that includes:
A Port Scanner to find open ports
A Brute-Force Login Module to test weak credentials
A Ping Sweep Tool to detect active hosts in a network
A WHOIS Lookup utility to gather domain registration info
# Tools & Technologies
Language: Python 3
Libraries Used:
socket – for network-level scanning
requests – for HTTP-based brute-force testing
os – to access system commands for pinging
json – for saving logs or data
argparse – to handle command-line options
# Thanks to CodTech for the opportunity to learn and implement hands-on cybersecurity practices. This task helped me grow as an ethical hacker and Python developer.
